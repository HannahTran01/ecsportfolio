<h2>How I started</h2>
<h6>I started basketball when I was in 2nd grade with Jr. Jazz. Basketball was the only thing I would look forward to everyday. It was until around 7th grade I had lost my love for basketball 
because of my coaches. Though it was a rough patch for me it showed me how to discipline myself and be able to withstand pressure. It overall made me a better player. Now no matter what my love for 
basketball would not go away because I know why I really love it.</h6>
